I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), under the supervision of [Prof. Jeong hwan Jeon](https://rml.unist.ac.kr). 

My research focuses on multi-agent coordination, reinforcement learning, optimization, and safe control for large-scale mobility systems. I aim to bridge theoretical foundation in optimization with practical reinforcement learning frameworks to enable sustainable and scalable autonomous mobility systems.
